# 📱 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction (Artificial Neural Network)
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer attrition (churn) in the telecommunications industry. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns, the model aims to identify at-risk customers to support proactive retention strategies.

* **🛠️ Technical Workflow**
The development process involves a structured deep learning pipeline implemented in Google Colab:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and performed categorical encoding for non-numeric features.

* **Feature Scaling:** Applied standardization techniques to ensure optimal convergence for the Neural Network.

* **ANN Architecture:** Built and trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Python-based deep learning frameworks.

* **📊 Dataset Information**

Source: Telecom Customer Churn Dataset – Kaggle.


* **Description: **The dataset contains information about phone and internet service subscriptions, account information, and demographic data.

* **🚀 Implementation & Results**
The model was trained using backpropagation and optimized to maximize classification accuracy.

* **Environment:** Developed using Python in a cloud-based Google Colab Notebook environment.

* **Key Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Deep Learning frameworks.
